Javascript-Maven-Tools
======================

#### Maven extensions and plug-ins for Javascript ####

Javascript-Maven-Tools provides maven plugins and extensions dedicated to
javascript development, either as standalone pure javascript librairies or
as part of web application. Its goal is to promote best development practices
with a standardized project organization, so that developers can be quickly
productive on a project and take advantage of the best tools available for
javascript development, documentation or quality assurance.

This project is a fork of the original project hosted at [codehaus](http://mojo.codehaus.org/javascript-maven-tools/)
which seems to be abandoned since a while, and has never reach a release version.
We introduce some major improvements, and in particular support for
Jasmine test, based on [jasmine-maven-plugin](https://github.com/searls/jasmine-maven-plugin).

### Targeted platforms ###dd

Javascript-Maven-Tools is build and tested on Maven2 and should work on any
Maven2 compatible platform.
